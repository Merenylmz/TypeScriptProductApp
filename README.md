# TypeScript ProductApp
 
This project is a TypeScript project that I made after a long time. In the project, we operate on a specific set of products.

# to run it
(Nodejs and TypeScript must be installed)
Open Terminal to the project path and type "tsc app.ts" and compile it, then type "node app.js" and run it.
